a word guessing game for the terminal written in golang

- developed on Ubuntu, looks as intended on the Kitty terminal
- output looks OK in the VSCode terminal on Windows
- output looks terrible in the default Windows command prompt
- I imagine the Windows Termainal might work, but the Windows computer I have access to can't install that
- default game picks a word of length 5, add a number after the executable to pick a different word length
